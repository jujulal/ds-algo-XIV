TDD/ A-TDD/BDD
-------------

```
a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: 
requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the 
new tests, only. 

This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is 
not proven to meet requirements.
