If the given problem can be broken up in to smaller sub-problems and 
these smaller subproblems are in turn divided in to still-smaller ones

the optimal solutions to the subproblems
-------

[1] Top down - memoization
[2] Bottom up - DP

----------------------------------

```
A DP is an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula and one (or some) starting states. 

A sub-solution of the problem is constructed from previously found ones.
