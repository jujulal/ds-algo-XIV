[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

```
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.


func search(nums []int, target int) int {
    
}
```


[287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

```
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Note:
- You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
- You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
- Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
- There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.


object Solution {
    def findDuplicate(nums: Array[Int]) : Int {
        0
    }
}
