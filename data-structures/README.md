[What is a cache hit and a cache miss? Why context-switching would cause cache miss?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18559358/432903)

_Whenever the processor wants to fetch data from main memory, first it will look at the cache buffer to 
see whether the corresponding address is present in the buffer. If it is there, it will perform the 
operation by using the cache; no need to fetch from the main memory. This is called a "Cache hit"._
