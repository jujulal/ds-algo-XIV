which are not being used by a Java application anymore. 

It is a form of automatic memory management.

[When is the finalize() method called in Java?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2506525/432903) (INTV, 06-18-2016)

```
The finalize method is called when an object is about to get garbage collected. 
That can be at any time after it has become eligible for garbage collection.
